How to use 
====

Quite simple, just attach the element you wish with the plugin! 
For example, $('.tabs-wrapper').jTabs();


Default options: 
- Class "active" for the active li tab,
- Class "active-block" for the active container,
- Anchor is the default element that contains the attribute that links to the container you wish to show
- Href is the attribute that contains the name of the container
- Click is the default event


Default options are very easy to alter.
$('.tabs-wrapper').jTabs({
  contentClass: "active-container",     //Alters the class of active container from "active-block" to "active-container"
  buttonClass: "active-button",         //Alters the class of active button from "active" to "active-button"
  mouseEvent: "mouseover"               //Alters the event from "click" to "mouseover"
});  


You can also pass no class names.
$('.tabs-wrapper').jTabs({
  contentClass: ""                     //Alters the class of active container from "active-block" to no-class
});
